# Best Things Ever

## File

* [`best_things_ever.txt`](Unsolved/best_things_ever.txt)

## Instructions

* Create a Python application that reads the `best_things_ever.txt` file, parses the comma separated elements, and ultimately prints each element in the file on separate lines.

* Your final output should look something like this:

```
  	Farley
 	Flarley in a sweater
 	dogs dressed as cats
 	lazy boy recliner
 	meditation
 	hot coffee
 	kittens (yes Plural) falling asleep on my lap
```

### Hints

* If you are struggling to figure out how to loop your way through the text, look into the `.split()` method. This could make your life a whole lot easier.
